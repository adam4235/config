Thunderbird settings I had to change from the defaults:
What I had to change for new accounts:
-Reply-to address for fastmail
-Archive folder and Archive options to be a single folder
-Don't compose messages in HTML format
-Junk settings - don't mark mail as Junk
-For adam.richard@unb.ca and adam.richard2020@outlook.com, had to uncheck the box to save a copy in the Sent folder when sending messages - otherwise 2 copies get saved there.

-Change store location for Local Folders to the one in my archive folder
