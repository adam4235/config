For virtualbox, to change the display resolution:
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms

For virtualbox, had to install the extension pack to get USB 2.0 and 3.0.
Also had to disable Sleep Timers in Windows 10 to prevent Virtualbox from waking up the computer from sleep right after it went to sleep.
