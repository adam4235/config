Config changes for using Linux as a guest in VirtualBox:

To change the display resolution, I had to install the guest additions.  Originally I did this:
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms

But on my Debian VirtualBox that didn't work.  The instructions to install it using VirtualBox worked.  Basically:

1. With the Linux guest running, from the VirtualBox menu select Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD Image.  This inserts a virtual CD (.iso) into the Linux guest containing some software to install.
2. Mount the cd and install the guest additions:
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
cd /mnt
sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --nox11

Had to install the extension pack to get USB 2.0 and 3.0.

Also had to disable Sleep Timers in Windows 10 to prevent Virtualbox from waking up the computer from sleep right after it went to sleep.
(Power and Sleep settings -> Additional Power settings -> Change plan settings -> Change advanced power settings -> sleep -> Allow Wake Timers -> Disable)

I had the gvim --sync issue too, where gvim doesn't refresh properly unless run with the --sync option.  But on Debian adding --sync didn't solve it.

Also my USB key kept getting unmounted and getting issues (on Debian, at least).
