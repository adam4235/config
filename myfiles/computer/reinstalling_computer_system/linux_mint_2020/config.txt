*hotkeys - if using i3, already configured in the config file
	Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts
	Super+F2:
	exo-open --launch WebBrowser
	Super+F:
	pick_file
	Super+Enter:
	launch terminal
*disable other hotkeys so they don't conflict with i3, but leave the Print Screen button, and make Ctrl+Alt+Del run xfce4-session-logout
restore cookies to firefox (cookies.sqlite) - for e.g. stock quotes and logins
    in fact restore all firefox settings
*Change keyboard repeat rate
    Restore ~/.xinitrc

*Run visudo and set it so I don't have to enter my password to sudo
adam ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

xfce4-session-settings:
*disable locking the screen before sleep
*disable the locker from starting at all

These can be restored by backing up / restoring $HOME/.config/autostart
*set onstartup and internet to run at startup
*set disk to get mounted at startup, not just when plugged in
    by adding this command to Startup applications:
    udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/DISK2S1
    (From https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions)

For i3:
*under Application Autostart, make i3 start
*under Session, set xfdesktop and xfwm4 to start "Never", then click "Save Session"

To sync computer with iphone:
I needed this definition in smb.conf:
[iphone]
path = /home/adam/myfiles/iphone
writeable = yes
browseable = yes
public = yes
create mask = 0644
directory mask = 0755
force user = adam

Have to update /etc/samba/smb.conf to include ~/.smb.conf
