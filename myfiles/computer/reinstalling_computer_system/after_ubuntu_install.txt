While the LiveCD is still going, you have to:
-fix the grub installation by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst (on Artaxerxes, add noapic option, since the motherboard has a bug)
-fix the /etc/fstab
-restore /etc/groups and /etc/passwd, so my user (adam) has the correct userid and can view the files in my home directory

-restore files in /etc that were backed up:
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules so my devices work (also, I may need to change the rules sometimes, since they keep changing how they're written)

-disable many services at startup (including the Volume Manager, so I can mount my usbkey)
-Maybe disable automatic device management (to make my camera work):
Open gnome registry: 
gconf-editor
Uncheck the key:
/apps/nautilus/preferences/media_automount

Make my startup script start at startup (if it doesn't already)

Make my USB disk get added at log in (if it doesn't already) by adding this command to Startup applications:
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/disk/by-label/DISK2S1
(From https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions)

Run visudo and set it so all users of admin don't have to enter their password to sudo
sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

-Make clock synced automatically (in Ubuntu, this is done under the Time and Date configuration in the GUI - you have to install NTP support)

-Make Parole be the default for .mp3 files instead of gmusicbrowser (the latter seems pointless)

sudo su

sudo apt-get remove tracker

sudo apt-get -y install vim-gtk
sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ rawdog dmenu
sudo apt-get -y install chromium-browser
